                    <p>
                        I am super interested in spatial design. I like using
                        transmission structures like gears and cranks to
                        build different devices with different functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have been a huge fan of precise robots since I was
                        young. Every time when I see a machine driven by
                        several transmission components, I dream to build
                        one on my own, and that dream is finally achieved
                        when I take IAT 106. To create such a device, I
                        used a web called Onshape, for it provides me
                        with a visualized modeling environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The whole process took about four weeks and five major
                        steps. The installation is based on a box. At the top
                        center of the box, there is a ball back and forth. Beside
                        the box, there is a hand holding on a box. The hand is keep
                        managing to tipping the ball. Yet the chance the hand can
                        reach the ball is fully random.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The installation build up with several different
                        forms of transmission. There are different combinations of cranks
                        works together to drive the finger move. There are also gears and
                        transmission shaft to deliver the power to the hands.

                    <h2>Step 1: Ideation and Sketching</h2>
                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the ideation period, I decided to design a hand that clenched its fist. This
                        idea was inspired by the movie Iron Man and Terminator since both movies
                        provided a close-up shot when they clenched their fist while checking body
                        status.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sketching</h3>
                    <p>
                        The next step was to develop several plans to make the finger move. This step took me
                        the largest percentage of time since I had tofind a perfect balance between the
                        aesthetics of the structure and the possibility of implementation. Finally, I
                        chose to use the crank as the transmission part to drive the finger move.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Set Size and Ratio</h3>
                    <p>
                        The next step was to finalize the length and width of each component. The purpose of
                        this step was to make the palm looks more real, and each transmission component
                        inside the device works perfectly. The picture shown on the right side was a crank
                        used in the middle of the finger

                    <h3>Components</h3>
                    <p>
                        After I finished all paperwork, I started to build small components for each
                        transmission component, for instance, cranks. Though the most size calculation 
                        has done during the Sketching, there is still some data that need to be adjusts. 
                        Datas like the thickness of each components and other changes during the designing 
                        changes will be recalculated during this process.

                    <h3>Assembling</h3>
                    <p>
                        After I finish build the basic components, I started to assembling them into each 
                        mechanical Components like cranks and crankshaft. This process is also critical, since 
                        I need to test whether those components could assembled and work as I designed.
