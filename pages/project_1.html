                    I am super interested in spatial design. I like using
                    transmission structures like gears and cranks to
                    build different devices with different functions.
                </p>
                <p>I have been a huge fan of precise robots since I was
                    young. Every time when I see a machine driven by
                    several transmission components, I dream to build
                    one on my own, and that dream is finally achieved
                    when I take IAT 106. To create such a device, I
                    used a web called Onshape, for it provides me
                    with a visualized modeling environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole process took about four weeks and five major
                    steps. The installation is based on a box. At the top
                    center of the box, there is a ball back and forth. Beside
                    the box, there is a hand holding on a box. The hand is keep
                    managing to tipping the ball. Yet the chance the hand can
                    reach the ball is fully random.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The installation build up with several different
                    forms of transmission. There are different combinations of cranks
                    works together to drive the finger move. There are also gears and
                    transmission shaft to deliver the power to the hands.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project was trying to express the idea that the
                    control of opportunities and attempts to overcome difficulties
                    are like the hands in this model. Although it tries its best
                    to reach the ball every time, the final results are not always
                    satisfactory. However, we still need to get ourselves at our
                    best condition for next opportunities.

            This project is a spatial design project from IAT 106. In this project, I designed a hand holding on a box,
            the box have a ball and the band keep managed to tipping at the ball. Yet depending on the mechanism of a
            four-bar linkage,
            whether the hand can reach the ball is fully random.
