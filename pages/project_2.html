                        <span>A IAT 336 Project</span>Introduction:
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        This project is a VR design project that I worked with 
                        three other group members on Fall, 2022. The goal of
                        this project is to produce a cool, unique and comfortable 
                        device.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The whole process took about four weeks and five major
                        steps. The installation is based on a box. At the top
                        center of the box, there is a ball back and forth. Beside
                        the box, there is a hand holding on a box. The hand is keep
                        managing to tipping the ball. Yet the chance the hand can
                        reach the ball is fully random.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The installation build up with several different
                        forms of transmission. There are different combinations of cranks
                        works together to drive the finger move. There are also gears and
                        transmission shaft to deliver the power to the hands.

                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <p>
                        To acieve that purpose, we started tons of research to come up
                        with some cool mechanism.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sketching</h3>
                    <p>
                        The next step was to sketch components with a rough density to see whether 
                        our design works. To do so, we drew the key component and its size to calculate
                        whether our size was in a correct range.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Build Digital Model In Software</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the last step of this section, we have build the sketch in to digital 
                        model based on the size we calculate, and adjuest the incorrect size. This 
                        step is critical for us, since it can simulate the real model and tell us 
                        the direction we need to improve and the mistake we need to fixed before 
                        we actally laser cut our components.
                    </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Components Modeling</h2>
            <div class="my_info_detail">
                <div class="left" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">

                    <h3>Rough Model</h3>
                    <p>
                        After we finished the digital design, we started build our physical rough model 
                        the purpose of this was to build a rough model with a card paper to see is there 
                        is any design flaws that we havn't covered in the digital design part. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Functioning Check</h3>
                    <p>
                        Another Important thing we need to do in this step is to check whether each 
                        functions we designed works perfectly as we expected. Especiatelly the mechanism 
                        structure. After we checked every step, we started to simplify the design. The 
                        goal of this process was to create a device that can make same or better 
                        function with more simple mechnism.

                    <h3>Planning laser cut</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since then, we started planning laser cut our model and assembled it into 
                        the fully function model. During this process, we have have designed several 
                        sets of spare parts in case we have mistakenly use or broke our laser cut pieces.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Embroidery Choosing</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to enhance the unique of our project, we decide to use embroidery 
                        to decorate our device and help reduce its weight. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Assembling</h3>
                    <p>
                        After we get the laser cut piece, we started to assembled those pieces into our 
                        model. during this process, we have still faced some challenge like the glue works 
                        on card paper, but not wood. It tooks us few more time on solving those unexpected 
                        problems. But lucklly, our prepareing work was well-considered and that save us huge 
                        amount of time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Final Model</h3>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we got our fully-functional model.
